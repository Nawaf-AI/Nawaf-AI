def send_reminder(team):

pending_sessions = [session for session in   team.sessions
if session.status == 'upcoming']

    for session in pending_sessions:
    
    team.notify_players(f'Reminder: Training
    
    session {session.name} is scheduled for
    tomorrow!')
    
    print(f'Reminder sent for session
    {session.name}')
    
    team_name = 'Thunderbolts FC'
    
    send_reminder(get_team_by_name(team_name))
